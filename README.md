Grove St PATH in downtown Jersey City is the most popular bike station for trip start, trip end, and among subscribers who have annual Citi Bike pass. But, among 24-hour pass or 3-day pass users, Liberty Light Rail bike station is the most popular one. This makes sense because Liberty Light Rail bike station is adjacent to the gorgeous Liberty State Park. So, most of the riders here are tourists or local visitors who would use 24-hour or 3-day pass. Where as Grove St PATH bike station is adjacent to mass public transportion. So, riders here are daily commuters who would have annual pass for Citi Bike.
